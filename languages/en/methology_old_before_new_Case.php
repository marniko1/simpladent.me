        <h1>Immediate Loading Implantology Today</h1>
        <div class="article">
            <h2>What are Basal Implantology and Strategic Implantology?</h2>
            <p>The term "Strategic Implant" is a registered trademark for the implants of the Simpladent Group. The term "basal implantology" first appeared around 1999; at a time of breakthrough in modern dental implantology: immediate loading technology was developed. It simultaneously solved the problem of low bone supply and enables patients with diabetes and other medical issues to receive treatment.</p>
            <p>Each implant is fixated in at least two locations in cortical bone. This type of bone provides a high level of mineralization and stability, can be immediately loaded and practically does not resorb in a patient's lifetime. Bone augmentation, sinus lift, bone transplants and waiting periods become unnecessary. </p>
            <p>With the help of the Strategic Implant, we are able to successfully supply treatment even in cases of severe bone atrophy. The patient receives a beautiful smile within just a few days.</p>

    <div class="note">Thousands of patients have been treated globally with over 1.000,000 placed implants.</div>

            <h2>6 advantages of Strategic Implantology:</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Patients requesting the implants can be treated practically without exception - regardless of the extent of bone loss or whether residual teeth are present.</li>
                <li>Only one single surgical intervention is necessary. Strategic Implants are splinted with (permanent or semi-permanent) bridges very soon after the implant placement. If desired, another bridge (for instance of a different material) may be placed after 6-9 months. In many cases however the first bridge will be the final one.</li>
                <li>The low number of surgeries and other treatment steps reduces overall cost. Rapid and effective measures can be taken by our qualified specialists should complications occur.</li>
                <li>Implants with slim design interfere with the host bone's blood supply much less than comparable conventional implants.</li>
				<li>The polished implants are virtually free from peri-implantitis, a dangerous infection found only around conventional implants. Peri-implantitis leads to serious problems and severe bone loss. The infection is not found around Strategic Implants. Please visit www.peri-implantitis.info for further information. </li>
                <li>Because Strategic Implants can be immediately loaded, patients can quickly return to their normal life.</li>

            <p>The Immediate Loading technology has been continually improved throughout the last decade in the Simpladent research center in cooperation with Dr. Ihde Dental AG. Further information can be found on www.simpladent.ch and www.boi.ch. The training of specialized implantologists is exclusively conducted by the International Implant Foundation, Munich (www.implantfoundation.org).</p>
            <p>Beyond that Simpladent GmbH has also developed a revolutionary treatment concept in cooperation with maxillo-facial department of the Belgrade University (Prof. V. Konstantinovic/ Prof. Lazic). These two experts are the pioneers and leading specialists in the placement of lateral and screwable strategic implants in the frontal bone, mastoid, and glabella. </p>
            <p>Of course the developments do not stop here. Simpladent's strategic implants are currently the most advanced implant types available and in use around the world. </p>

        <h1>Implant types</h1>
        <div class="article">

            <p>Simpladent GmbH produces more than 50 types of implants for immediate loading to deal with any dental problems. However, not only the right implant choice is important, but also the implantologist's skill. The Simpladent Group's specialists receive a profound basic education, additional schooling for the proper handling of different implant types, and they are obligated to seek annual re-training. All training is according to the high quality standard in Switzerland and Germany. Our specialists' skills exceed those of regular implantologists. This ensures the treatment by an expert professional.</p>

							<p>Example 3: None of the patientâs remaining teeth were worth saving. Therefore all teeth in the upper and lower jaw were removed and a total of 19 Strategic Implants were inserted. Two days later the prosthetic construction was ready and the bridges were cemented with definitive cement. Regular chewing function was possible immediately. The lower x-ray was taken 11 months post-operatively.  All infected areas in the jaw bones had healed, the picture shows good bone in all places.</p>
