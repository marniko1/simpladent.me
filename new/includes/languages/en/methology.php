            <h2>What is “Basal Implantology”?</h2>
            <p>The term "basal implantology" appeared more than 15 years ago. At this time a breakthrough in modern dental implantatology started. The technology was developed to cope with the most difficult cases of strong atrophy and when it seemed that there was no other way to help the patient. Today also diabetic patients and patients with other medical issues may receive treatment through basal implants.</p>
            <p>Every implant is fixated at least in two locations in cortical bone. This type of bone provides a high level of mineralization.  The implants are placed exclusively into the dense bone, which everybody has. </p>
            <p>Cortical bone is very capable for load transmission, due to it's high level of mineralization. It gives an opportunity for immediate loading and possibility to place the bridge immediately after implantation. Thus, even in cases of severe bone loss, and complete adentia the patient can get a beautiful smile after within a few days and max. 3 days!!</p>

            <h2>5 advantages of basal implantology:</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>All patients who request the implants can be treated, without exception, regardless of the extent of bone loss or the presence of absence of residual teeth.</li>
                <li>Only one single intervention is necessary. Basal implants are splinted with (permanent or semi-permanent) bridges very soon after the implant placement. If requested, a final bridge may be places 10-50 weeks later. In many cases the first bridge will be the final one.</li>
                <li>The low number of surgical and other treatment steps reduces overall cost. Rapid and effective measures can be taken should complications occur.</li>
                <li>Basal implants hardly interfere with the blood supply to the host bone, at any rate much less than comparable conventional implants.</li>
                <li>Because basal implants can be immediately loaded, patients can quickly return back to their normal life.</li>

            <p>In the last decade, thanks to the hard work of surgeons and research center of "Dr. Ihde Dental AG"  (www.implant.com) in cooperation with the International Implant Foundation (www.implantfoundation.org), basal implantology has reached a high level of perfection. The technology combines usage of basal and cortical bone with the help of patented BOI® /TOI ® implants and elastically designed, patented  basal screw implants (BCS®, GBC ® ).</p>
            <p>Dr. Ihde Dental AG has developed this treatment concept in cooperation with maxillo-facial department of the Belgrade University (Prof. V. Konstantinovic/ Prof. Lazic). They are the true pioneers and the world-wide  leading specialists in this field, i.e. in the placement of lateral and screwable basal implants in the frontal bone, the mastoid, and the glabella. </p>
            <p>Of course, the development will not stop here. Today the basal implants produced by Dr. Ihde Dental are the best basal implant system currently available and thez are used in many countries.</p>

        <h1>Implant types</h1>
        <div class="article">

            <p>Dr Ihde Dental company produces more than 50 types of implants to deal with any dental problems. Specialists of the Simpladent  Association can always offer you any of the existing types of implants, the most suitable for prosthetics. However, when choosing the implant not only their variety and quality matter, but also the skills of your doctor. That is why all the doctors of the association take training and retraining on the bases of Swiss and German clinics. This ensures an optimal, correct individual choice of the implant for each individual case.</p>

        <p>Inspection of the oral cavity and x-ray examination are done by the treatment provider. After all questions have been answered the treatment date is agreed. The treatment  is often begun immediately because the precuations necessary for conventinal implants (improvement of oral hygiene, periodontal pre-treatment, etc) are not necessary for basal implants, if the involved teeth are simply extracted.</p>
        <p>On the day of operation the teeth are being extracted (if any)  and the modern basal implants, produced  by Dr. Ihde Dental AG in Switzerland, are placed.  Right after the implants are installed, the prosthetical treatment starts: impressions are taken and the bite is registered. After a few hours, maximum during the next day the metal frame try-in or the plastic template (for zirkonium works) will be made. And on the 2nd or 3rd  postoperative day the bridge will be definitively fixed. On this day you can start trying all possibilities of your new teeth - eating, smiling, talking!!!</p>

        <p>All Simpladent-Implants are supplied by the manufacturer with a lifetime warranty. This means that the implants and parts will be replaced free of charge.</p>
        <p>A guaranty on the services of a doctor can not be offered, because healing depends mainly on the patient.  Nevertheless the members of Simpladent-group typically will help either free of charge or at a significantly reduced price, if single implants or prosthetical workpieces must be exchanged due to unexpected events. The period for this kind of guarantee is usually 4 years.</p>
        <p>Please note that for keeping the guarantee valid, regular controll appointments in a qualified Simpladent-Clinic are necessary.</p>
        <p>The request for guaranty can be made in every Simpladent clinic (except presently in Russia).</p>
