            <blockquote>In the early 90s I was working in the south of Switzerland. I had one job and 6,000 patients. It was crazy, ... so much work. It was then when I realized that dentistry need something that will work reliably and immediately - without time-consuming operations and months for the fixation. Patients did not have enough monez and not enough bone for the conventional implants. At that time the ideas for modern strategic implantolog" were layed out and I started working on this concept. </blockquote>

        <h1>History</h1>
        <div class="article">
            <p><strong>Dr.IhdeDental</strong> was founded in 1954 by the dentist technician Klaus Ihde in Berlin. From the very first days of its existence the company has recommended itself as a supplier of high quality consumables for dentistry. At the end of the 80th the  trading company was transformed into <strong>Dr.IhdeDental</strong> group and manufacturing started.</p>
            <p>Dr IhdeDental company is one of the world's leading manufacturers of dental implants for immediate loading procedures. Today its products are used inmore than 40 countries. More than 100,000 implants are produced annually at the company's factory in Switzerland.</p>
            <p>Dr. IhdeDental has developed implants which work even in unusual cases and in situations with very low bone. Thereby bone transplants and augmentations became unnecessary.</p>
            <p>Companies leader is a Prof. Stefan Ihde, a dentist with dental education from West-Germany. He is also periodontologist and oral surgeon, as well as the developer and founder of modern basal implantology. Under his leadership a worldwide  Simpladenе association of dental clinics was formed.</p>

            <h2>What are the advantages of the Simpladent concept?</h2>
            <p>The Simpladent-concept has changed the world of implantology completely!.</p>
            <p> in our clinics you will become free of all dental worries and will be back in your normal life very quickly.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Every patient can get fixed teeth right away, without waiting out the healing period and without without bone augmentations or intermediate dentures.</li>
                <li>Our extensively trained surgeons utilize cortical bone in all areas of the maxillo-facial skeletton. This bone is resorption-stable and strong. For this reason we install bridges right away and splint the implants thereby.</li>
                <li>Specialized dentist-technician will give you a sound and safe bite through these bridges. You may eat everything right after the bridges are installed!</li>

        <h2>What can we offer for you?</h2>
        <p>Our treatment concept aims at solving all of your problems at the same time, such as:</p>
        <ul>
	    <li>missing teeth, inability to eat and smile; </li>
            <li>periodontal problems (inflammation of the gums, tooth mobility); </li>
            <li>endodontic problems (granulomas, cysts); </li>
            <li>problems with heavily decayed or reconstructed teeth;</li>
            
        </ul>
        <p>Typically we approach all those problems in one step. Removal of teeth and placement of implants are done in the same appointment, and right after this our lab-team starts working on your new teeth. To avoid future problems, also ailing teeth, i.e. teeth which are likely to cause problems within the next 5 years, will also be removed an replaced by implants.</p>
        <p>Our experience out of thousands of implant operations and case observations clearly shows, that implants are in adult patients much more relyable than teeth. </p>

                       The Simpladent&reg; -concept of  implant treatment is offered today in many countries. It replaces conventional dental implantology on 2-stage implants.
The treatment concept was invented by Prof. Dr. Stefan Ihde during his work in the clinic in Gommiswald/Switzerland. The implants and components for this concept are produced by Dr. Ihde Dental AG, 8737 Gommiswald/Switzerland.
